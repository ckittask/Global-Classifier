# OOD Detection Analysis Report

*Date: 2025-05-03 03:36:56*

## Overview

This report analyzes the performance of various OOD detection methods for conversation classification. The goal is to identify the most effective approach for detecting out-of-distribution examples while maintaining high accuracy on in-distribution data.

## Methods Evaluated

1. **SNGP (Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process)**: Enhances distance awareness through spectral normalization and Gaussian process output layer.
2. **Energy-based OOD Detection**: Uses energy scores as uncertainty measures.
3. **SNGP + Energy**: Combines SNGP with energy-based detection.
4. **OOD as a Class**: Treats OOD examples as an additional class during training.
5. **Softmax Threshold**: Uses softmax probabilities or entropy for uncertainty estimation.
